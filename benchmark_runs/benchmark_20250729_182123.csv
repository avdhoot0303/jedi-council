The premise ""all Wookies are strong"" establishes that strength is a characteristic of all members of the Wookie species. Since Chewbacca is identified as a Wookie, he inherits the characteristic of being strong. This is a straightforward application of deductive reasoning, where a general rule is applied to a specific case."
